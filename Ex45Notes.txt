- Final Fantasy like Combat System
- Actual Map System
- Items?
- Random Encounters
- Random generated map? In new Window?
- Leveling System?
- Healthbars?
- Random enemy names?

- Dungeon Crawler
- Not big tho


- Big Focus on Interactive Map System and Combat System -> As long as that works game is cool

MAP
Rooms can be just single space meaning Rooms are Generally Hallways
Hallway
**HallwayNW
**HallwayNS
**HallwayNE
**HallwayN
**HallwayW
**HallwayWE
**HallwayWS
**HallwayS
**HallwaySE
**HallwayE

With random encounters, less different rooms have to be created, meaning less programming.
Final Boss fight needs to be done


FIGHTING SYSTEM
System based on Health only. Special attacks that cost health give certain advantages.
This is something I haven't seen yet and could potentially make the game more interesting than
"Hey lets do a manasystem".
Armor to support health though.
Actions avaiable would be 'Attack, Special Move, Item, Run'.

Pawn - General Object every character can use, with health variable, armor variable, itemlist and attack stats
*Player character
*Enemy - Let's do 3 enemy types? Weak, Elite and the Big Boss. Maybe load in graphic from txt, since that one doesn't change.
